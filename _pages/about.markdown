As you probably know from the title of the page, I am Nikhil Nayak. I do not take any responsibilty whatsoever of your feelings after you read this description. Be it creepily nauseating or be it exceedingly joyous, you and only you shall be held responsible for your fate. Choose wisely, its not necessary you take the blue one, like Neo did.

I am a fan of Machine Learning and Virtual Reality. I hate redundancy and I like to automize stuff that consume (or could consume) my time on a highly frequent basis. Basically I like to make the computer do as much as it can for me. That's why I used Jekyll to make this site and removed the old redundant HTML way of hosting personal sites.
